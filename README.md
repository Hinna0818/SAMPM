# 🧬 SAMPM: Successful Aging Prediction Models based on Machine Learning
## Overview
This repository aims to build machine learning models to predict successful aging outcomes based on health conditions, lifestyle factors, and chronic disease history.
We apply a variety of popular machine learning algorithms to explore predictive performance and model interpretability.

## 🚀 Models Implemented
### MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

### CatBoost (Categorical Boosting)

### Random Forest (RF)

### Logistic Regression (LR)

### Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)

### XGBoost

### LightGBM

Each model serves as a baseline for further hyperparameter optimization and performance comparison.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

### F1 Score

### ROC-AUC Score

### Precision and Recall

### AUC-PR (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve)

### Brier Score

### Accuracy

Both training set and test set ROC curves are plotted for detailed performance comparison.

## 🔍 Model Interpretability
The project incorporates advanced interpretability techniques:

### SHAP Analysis (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

### ALE Plots (Accumulated Local Effects)

These allow insights into feature contributions and model behavior.

## 🛠 Future Work
### 📈 Introduce deep learning models (e.g., TabTransformer)

### 🛡️ Implement imbalance handling techniques (e.g., SMOTE, EasyEnsemble)

### 🎯 Perform full hyperparameter optimization using Optuna

### 🌍 Extend dataset and validate across multiple cohorts
